                <p>Security is one of the biggest considerations in everything we do. If you have any questions after reading this, or encounter any issues, please contact us at <strong>security@bigearth.io</strong>.</p>
                <h2 class="blog-post-title">SSL/TLS &amp; CSRF</h2>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">Encryption between client and server</p>
                <p>HTTPS is enforced for every connection to our website using 2048-bit digital signatures and 128-bit encryption. We also use HTTP Strict Transport Security to ensure requests never interact with our servers over insecure HTTP. Our servers are also protected against CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) and Session Fixation.</p>
                
                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Server side best practices</h2>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">Encryption for private user data</p>
                <p>All secrets, credentials and API keys are stored as environment variables and never hardcoded. All passwords are hashed with the bcrypt algorithm including both a pepper and a salt to battle rainbow tables.</p>
                <p>We confirm new profiles via email and also lock profiles down after a specified number of failed sign in attempts. Any time a blockchain is created or destroyed we send out an email to keep you up to date on any changes to your account.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">Static analysis security vulnerability scanner for Rails</p>
                <p>We pass <%= link_to 'Brakeman', 'http://brakemanscanner.org/docs/' %> w/ <strong>0 errors</strong> and <strong>0 security warnings</strong>. Brakeman tests for the following:</p>
                <p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Two Factor Authentication</h2>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">Something you know and something you have</p>
                <p>We enable Two Factor Authentication via <%= link_to 'Authy', 'https://www.authy.com/' %>. This enables you to add an extra layer of security to your account by requiring a PIN be sent to your phone, either via text or an app, which is used in combination w/ your password to sign in to your profile. This means that even if a bad guy gets your password they're still unable to sign in to your profile w/out your phone as well.</p>
                
                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Ubuntu</h2>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">A single non root user over ssh</p>
                <p>First we create a sudoer user. We then whitelist only that username in `sshd_config` and turn off the ability to sign in w/ a password and the ability to sign in as root. This means that *only* our single user can sign in to any of the machines in Big Earth's cloud and *only* over ssh.</p>
                
                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Chef</h2>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">Configuration Management &amp; Devops</p>
                <p>Chef gives us the peace of mind that we can spin up an entire cloud w/ each machine being a mirror image of the rest. RSA public key-pairs are used to authenticate a Chef client w/ a Chef server every time the client attempts to access the server.</p>
                
                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Rails Security</h2>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">Our foundation</p>
                <p>Ruby on Rails rolls best practices into the framework which leads developers to do the right thing out of the box. On top of that they have an active security team which keeps the framework up to date and secure as new issues arise. You can read about Rails security best practices.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">Platorms which we build on</p>
                <p>Big Earth Blockchain servers are hosted on Heroku and Digital Ocean. You can read about their security measures in place to protect our infrastructure.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">CloudFlare &amp; DNSSEC</h2>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">Worldwide CDN and Firewall</p>
                <p>Cloudflare handles our nameservers and DNS which enables us to be protected against the largest DDoS attacks on the Web. We also use them to compress our content and cache it on their edge servers to drastically improve site performance. We use CloudFlare to enable DNSSEC to authenticate DNS records.
